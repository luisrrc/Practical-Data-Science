In the third course of the Practical Data Science Specialization, you will learn a series of performance-improvement and cost-reduction techniques to automatically tune model accuracy, compare prediction performance, and generate new training data with human intelligence.  After tuning your text classifier using Amazon SageMaker Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT), you will deploy two model candidates into an A/B test to compare their real-time prediction performance and automatically scale the winning model using Amazon SageMaker Hosting. Lastly, you will set up a human-in-the-loop pipeline to fix misclassified predictions and generate new training data using Amazon Augmented AI and Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

**- Week 1: Advanced model training, tuning and evaluation:** Train, tune, and evaluate models using data-parallel and model-parallel strategies and automatic model tuning.

**- Week 2: Advanced model deployment and monitoring:** Deploy models with A/B testing, monitor model performance, and detect drift from baseline metrics.

**- Week 3: Data labeling and human-in-the-loop pipelines:** Label data at scale using private human workforces and build human-in-the-loop pipelines.
